# Netflix
In this project, I used a dataset containing all the movies and TV shows available on Netflix as of 2019.
I applied four different unsupervised learning algorithms, and I was able to separate the data on four clusters. This clusters can be successfully interpreted, and they appear to be really useful. Not only do we gain new knowledge about the data using them, but they also show that a user recommendation model could be built using this clustering.
